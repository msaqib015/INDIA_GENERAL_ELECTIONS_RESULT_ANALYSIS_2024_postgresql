# INDIA_GENERAL_ELECTIONS_RESULT_ANALYSIS_2024_postgresql

## Overview
This repository contains an in-depth analysis of the **India General Elections 2024** using **PostgreSQL**. The project focuses on querying, analyzing, and visualizing election results data to derive insights on voting patterns, party performances, and regional variations.

## Features
- **Structured Database**: Well-designed schema to store election data.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transformation of raw election data.
- **SQL Queries**: Predefined queries to extract insights on vote shares, seat distributions, and voter turnout.
- **Performance Metrics**: Analysis of party-wise and candidate-wise results.
- **Geographical Insights**: State-wise and constituency-wise breakdown.
- **Visualization Support**: Compatible with BI tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Python libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn).

## Dataset
The dataset consists of:
- Candidate-wise vote counts
- Party affiliations
- State and constituency details
- Voter turnout statistics
- Historical comparisons (where applicable)

## Database Schema
Tables included in the database:
1. **candidates** - Candidate details, party affiliations, and votes received.
2. **constituencies** - Information about constituencies and their demographics.
3. **parties** - Political parties and their aggregated results.
4. **voter_turnout** - Data on voter participation.
5. **historical_results** (optional) - Comparison with past election results.

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of SQL for executing queries.

### Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/INDIA_GENERAL_ELECTIONS_RESULT_ANALYSIS_2024_postgresql.git
   cd INDIA_GENERAL_ELECTIONS_RESULT_ANALYSIS_2024_postgresql
   ```
2. Import the database schema and sample data:
   ```sql
   psql -U your_username -d your_database -f schema.sql
   psql -U your_username -d your_database -f data.sql
   ```
3. Run predefined queries from `queries.sql` to extract insights.

## Usage
- Run **SQL queries** to analyze election results.
- Generate **visualizations** using BI tools.
- Compare **historical trends** to evaluate party performances over time.
- Derive **state-wise insights** for deeper analysis of voting patterns.

## Sample Queries
- Retrieve top 5 parties by total seats won:
  ```sql
  SELECT party, COUNT(*) as total_seats
  FROM candidates
  WHERE position = 1
  GROUP BY party
  ORDER BY total_seats DESC
  LIMIT 5;
  ```
- Find constituencies with the highest voter turnout:
  ```sql
  SELECT constituency, state, turnout_percentage
  FROM voter_turnout
  ORDER BY turnout_percentage DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```
